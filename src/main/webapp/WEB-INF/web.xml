<!-- 
	The 'version' above refers to the Servlet spec. Tomcat 7 implements version 3.0 	      
	      
	web.xml is the web app deployment descriptor.  It describes how the application should
	be deployed.  Note that Spring allow some aspects of the configuration to be performed 
	in source code using annotations.  This file must reside in the WEB-INF directory.
	  
	Tomcat7 implements the Servlet 3.0, JSP 2.2, EL 2.2 and Web Socket 1.1 specifications.  
	Tomcat7 supports Java version 6 and later; use of WebSockets requires Java 7 or later.

	Each JSP page has a default mode for EL expression evaluation.  The default for JSP pages 
	delivered with a Servlet 2.4 descriptor is to evaluate EL expressions.	If descriptor 2.3 or 
	less is used EL expressions are ignored.  Here we are specifying version 3.0.  If the EL 
	statements in JSP files are not being executed then check the Servlet version is greater
	than 2.3.
